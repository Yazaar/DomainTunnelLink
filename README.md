# DomainTunnelLink (DTL)
Create direct links between locally hosted TCP or web services to a publically accessible domain.

Host `tunnelServer.py` on a publically accessible server linked to a domain name and expose selected ports and/or subdomains behind password protection.

Run `tunnelClient.py` on a privately accessible server linked to a domain name and expose a locally running service.

Requirements: running on zero third-party dependencies
